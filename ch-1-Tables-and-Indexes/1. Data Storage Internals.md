# Data Storage Internals

## Database Files and FileGroups

Every database has one primary data file, which by default has an .mdf extension. In addition, every database can also have secondary database files. Those files, by default, have .ndf extensions. Transaction log files have .ldf extensions.

All database files are grouped into filegroups. A filegroup is a logical unit that simplifies database administration. It permits the logical separation of database objects and physical database files. When you create database objects—tables, for example—you specify what filegroup they should be placed into without worrying about the underlying data files’ configuration.

Transaction log throughput, on the other hand, does not benefit from multiple files. SQL Server works with transactional logs sequentially, and only one log file would be accessed at any given time.

OLTP systems and filegroups with volatile data usually benefit from multiple data files regardless of the underlying storage configuration. The optimal number of files depends on workload and the underlying hardware. As a rule of thumb, create four data files if the server has up to 16 logical CPUs, keeping a 1/8th ratio between files and CPUs afterward.

## Data Pages and Data Rows
The space in the database is divided into logical 8KB pages.

![The data page structure](assets/The%20data%20page%20structure.jpg)  
*The data page structure*

A 96-byte page header contains various pieces of information about a page, such as the object to which the page belongs, the number of rows and amount of free space available on the page, links to the previous and next pages if the page is in an index-page chain, and so on.

Following the page header is the area where actual data is stored. This is followed by free space. Finally, there is a slot array, which is a block of two-byte entries indicating the offset at which the corresponding data rows begin on the page.

The slot array indicates the logical order of the data rows on the page. If data on a page needs to be sorted in the order of the index key, **SQL Server does not physically sort the data rows on the page, but rather it populates the slot array based on the index sort order.**

Fixed-length data types, such as int, datetime, char, and others, always use the same amount of storage space regardless of their value, even when it is NULL. For example, the int column always uses 4 bytes and an nchar(10) column always uses 20 bytes to store information.

variable-length data types, such as varchar, varbinary, and a few others, use as much storage space as is required to store data, plus two extra bytes. For example, an nvarchar(4000) column would use only 12 bytes to store a five-character string and, in most cases, two bytes to store a NULL value. SQL Server does not maintain the information about the trailing NULL variable-length columns in the row.

You can reduce the size of the data row by creating tables in a manner in which variable-length columns, which usually store null values, are defined as the last ones in the CREATE TABLE statement. This is the only case in which the order of columns in the CREATE TABLE statement matters.

![Data row structure](/ch-1-Tables-and-Indexes/assets/Data%20row%20structure.jpg)  
*Data row structure*

The first two bytes of the row, called Status Bits A and Status Bits B, are bitmaps that contain information about the row, such as row type, if the row has been logically deleted (ghosted), and if the row has NULL values, variable-length columns, and a versioning tag. 

Null bitmap array uses one bit for each column of the table, regardless of whether it is nullable or not.

A null bitmap is always present in data rows in heap tables or clustered index leaf rows, even when the table does not have nullable columns. However, the null bitmap is not present in non-leaf index rows nor in leaf-level rows of nonclustered indexes when there are no nullable columns in the index.

An optional 14-byte versioning tag is used during operations that require row versioning, such as an online index rebuild, optimistic isolation levels, triggers, and a few others.

The fixed-length data and internal attributes must fit into the 8,060 bytes available on the single data page. SQL Server does not let you create the table when this is not the case.

## Large Objects Storage

SQL Server can store the variable-length data on different data pages. There are two different ways to store the data, depending on the data type and length.

### Row-Overflow Storage

SQL Server stores variable-length column data that does not exceed 8,000 bytes on special pages called row-overflow pages.

Data in row will be replaced with a 24-byte value. The first 16 bytes are used to store off-row storage metadata, such as type, length of the data, and a few other attributes. The last chunk of 8 bytes is the actual pointer to the row on the row-overflow page, which is made up by the file, page, and slot number.

![Row-overflow page pointer structure](/ch-1-Tables-and-Indexes/assets/Row-overflow%20page%20pointer%20structure.jpg)  
*Row-overflow page pointer structure*

### LOB Storage

For the text, ntext, or image columns, SQL Server stores the data off-row by default. It uses another kind of pages called a LOB data pages.

![LOB Logical structure](assets/LOB%20Logical%20structure.jpg)  
*LOB Logical structure*

When LOB data is less than 32 KB and can fit into five data pages, the LOB root structure contains the pointers to the actual chunks of LOB data. Otherwise, the LOB tree starts to include additional intermediate levels of pointers, similar to the index B-Tree.  

With the LOB allocation, the table data row stores less metadata information in the pointer and uses 16 bytes rather than the 24 bytes required by the row-overflow pointer.

The format, in which SQL Server stores the data from the (MAX) columns, such as varchar(max), nvarchar(max), and varbinary(max), depends on the actual data size. SQL Server stores it in-row when possible. When in-row allocation is impossible, and data size is less than or equal to 8,000 bytes, it is stored as row-overflow data. The data that exceeds 8,000 bytes is stored as LOB data.

> **Important**  
> text, ntext, and image data types are deprecated, and they will be removed in future versions of SQL Server. Use varchar(max), nvarchar(max), and varbinary(max) columns instead.

## SELECT * and I/O

Avoid using SELECT * when possible.  
For tables containing large columns, create different entities in ORM framework. So code won't accidently send select * command.

## Extents and Allocation Map Pages

SQL Server logically groups eight pages into 64 KB units called extents. There are two types of extents available: mixed extents store data that belongs to different objects, while uniform extents store the data for the same object.  

By default, when a new object is created, SQL Server stores the first eight object pages in mixed extents. After that, all subsequent space allocation for that object is done with uniform extents.

SQL Server uses a special kind of pages, called allocation maps, to track extent and page usage in a file.

### Global allocation map (GAM)
Pages track if extents have been allocated by any objects. The data is represented as bitmaps, 0 indicate that the corresponding extents are in use. Every GAM page covers about 64,000 extents, or almost 4 GB of data. This means that every database file has one GAM page for about 4 GB of file size.

### Shared global allocation map (SGAM)
Pages track information about mixed extents. The bit has a value of one if the corresponding extent is a mixed extent and has at least one free page available. Otherwise, the bit is set to zero. Like a GAM page, an SGAM page tracks about 64,000 extents, or almost 4 GB of data.

SQL Server can determine the allocation status of the extent by looking at the corresponding bits in the GAM and SGAM pages.

|Status|SGM bit|GAM bit|
|---|---|---|
|Free, not in use|0|1|
|Mixed extent with at least one free page available, not in use|1|0|
|Uniform extent or full mixed extent, not in use|0|0|

Even though mixed extents can save an insignificant amount of space in the database, they require SQL Server to perform more modifications of allocation map pages, which may become a source of contention in a busy system. It is especially critical for tempdb databases where small objects are usually created at a very fast rate. **TempDB should turn off mixed extents.**

### index allocation map (IAM)
SQL Server tracks the pages and extents used by the different types of pages (IN_ROW_DATA, ROW_OVERFLOW, and LOB pages) that belong to the object with another set of the allocation map pages, called the **index allocation map (IAM)**.  
*my understanding is it's a mapping between data page and GAM/SGAM*

### Page free space (PFS)
Page represents byte mask, where every byte stores information about a specific page.
![Page status byte in PFS page](assets/Page%20status%20byte%20in%20PFS%20page.jpg)

Every PFS page tracks 8,088 pages, or about 64 MB of data space.

### Differential changed map (DCM)
Page keeps track of extents that have been modified since the last FULL database backup. SQL Server uses DCM pages when it performs DIFFERENTIAL backups.

### Bulk changed map (BCM)
Page indicates which extents have been modified in minimally logged operations since the last transaction log backup. BCM pages are used only with a BULK-LOGGED database recovery model.

Both DCM and BCM pages are bitmasks that cover 511,230 pages in the data file.


## Data Modifications

***SQL Server does not read or modify data rows directly on the disk. Every time you access data, SQL Server reads it into memory.***
![Modifying data](assets/Data%20Modification%20process.jpg)

Finally, at some point, SQL Server asynchronously saves the dirty data pages into the data file and a special log record into the transaction log. This process is called a checkpoint.
![Modifying data](assets/Data%20Modification%20checkpoint.jpg)

The insert process works in a similar manner. SQL Server reads the data page where the new data row needs to be inserted into the buffer pool, or it allocates a new extent/page if needed. After that, SQL Server synchronously saves the transaction log record, inserts a row into the page, and asynchronously saves the data page to the disk. 

The same process transpires with deletions. As already mentioned, when you delete a row, SQL Server does not physically remove the row from the page. Rather, it flags deleted rows as ghosted (deleted) in the status bits. This speeds up deletion and allows SQL Server to undo it quickly if necessary.  
The deletion process also sets a flag in the PFS page indicating that there is a ghosted row on the page. SQL Server removes ghosted rows in the background through a task called ghost cleanup.

There is another SQL Server process called ***lazy writer*** that can save dirty pages on disk. As the opposite to checkpoint, which saves dirty data pages by keeping them in the buffer pool, lazy writer processes the least recently used data pages (SQL Server tracks buffer pool page usage internally), releasing them from memory. It releases both dirty and clean pages, saving dirty data pages on disk during the process. As you can guess, lazy writer runs **in case of memory pressure or when SQL Server needs to bring more data pages to the buffer pool.**

## Much Ado about Data Row Size

You can improve the performance of the system by reducing the size of the data rows. One of the ways to do this is by using the smallest data type that covers the domain values when you create tables. For example:  
- Use bit instead of tinyint, smallint, or int to store Boolean values. The bit data type uses one byte of storage space per eight columns.
- Use the appropriate date/time data type based on the precision you need. For example, an order-entry system can use smalldatetime (four bytes of storage space) or datetime2(0) (six bytes of storage space) rather than datetime (eight bytes of storage space) to store information on when an order was placed into the system when one-minute or one-second precision is enough. 
- Use decimal or real rather than float whenever possible. Similarly, use money or smallmoney data types rather than float to store monetary values.
- Do not use large fixed-length char/binary data types unless the data is always populated and static in size.

## Table Alteration

There are three different ways that SQL Server can proceed, as follows:  
1. Alteration requires changing the metadata only. Examples of such an alteration include dropping a column, changing a not nullable column to a nullable one, or adding a nullable column to the table. 
2. Alteration requires changing the metadata only, but SQL Server needs to scan the table data to make sure it conforms to the new definition. You can think about changing a nullable column to be not nullable, as an example. SQL Server needs to scan all data rows in the table to make sure that there are no null values stored in a particular column before changing the table metadata.
3. Alteration requires changing every data row in addition to the metadata. An example of such an operation is changing a column data type in a way that requires either a different storage format or a type conversion. For example, when you change a fixed-length char column to varchar.

Unfortunately, table alteration **never decreases the size of a data row.** When you drop a column from a table, SQL Server does not reclaim the space that the column used.  
The only way to reclaim the space is by rebuilding a heap table or clustered index.

## Summary
SQL Server stores data in databases that consist of one or more transaction log files and one or more data files. Data files are combined into filegroups. Filegroups abstract the database file structure from database objects, which are logically stored in the filegroups rather than in database files. You should consider creating multiple data files for any filegroups that store volatile data.

SQL Server always zeros out transaction logs during a database restore and log file auto-growth. By default, it also zeros out data files unless instant file initialization is enabled. Instant file initialization significantly decreases database restore time and makes data file auto-growth instant. However, there is a small security risk associated with instant file initialization, as the uninitialized part of the database may contain data from previously deleted OS files. Nevertheless, it is recommended that you enable instant file initialization if such a risk is acceptable.

SQL Server stores information on 8,000 data pages combined into extents. There are two types of extents. Mixed extents store data from different objects. Uniform extents store data that belongs to a single object. SQL Server stores the first eight object pages in mixed extents. After that, only uniform extents are used during object space allocation. You should consider enabling trace flag T1118 to prevent mixed extents space allocation and reduce allocation map pages contention.

SQL Server uses special map pages to track allocations in the file. There are several allocation map types. GAM pages track which extents are allocated. SGAM pages track available mixed extents. IAM pages track extents that are used by the allocation units on the object (partition) level. PFS stores several page attributes, including free space available on the page, in heap tables and in row-overflow and LOB pages.

SQL Server stores actual data in data rows. There are two different kinds of data types available. Fixed-length data types always use the same storage space regardless of the value, even when it is NULL. Variable-length data storage uses the actual data value size.

The fixed-length part of the row and internal overhead must fit into a single data page. Variable-length data can be stored in separate data pages, such as row-overflow and LOB pages, depending on the actual data size and data type.

SQL Server reads the data pages into a memory cache called the buffer pool. When data is modified, SQL Server synchronously writes the log record into the transaction log. It saves the modified data pages asynchronously during the checkpoint and lazy writer processes.

SQL Server is a very I/O-intensive application, and reducing the number of I/O operations helps to improve the performance of systems. It is beneficial to reduce the size of data rows by using optimal data types. This allows you to put more rows in the data page and decreases the number of data pages to be processed during scan operations.

You need to be careful when altering tables. This process never decreases the size of rows. The unused space from the rows can be reclaimed by rebuilding a table or clustered index.
