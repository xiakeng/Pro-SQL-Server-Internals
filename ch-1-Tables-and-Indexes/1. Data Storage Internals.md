# Data Storage Internals

## Database Files and FileGroups

Every database has one primary data file, which by default has an .mdf extension. In addition, every database can also have secondary database files. Those files, by default, have .ndf extensions. Transaction log files have .ldf extensions.

All database files are grouped into filegroups. A filegroup is a logical unit that simplifies database administration. It permits the logical separation of database objects and physical database files. When you create database objects—tables, for example—you specify what filegroup they should be placed into without worrying about the underlying data files’ configuration.

Transaction log throughput, on the other hand, does not benefit from multiple files. SQL Server works with transactional logs sequentially, and only one log file would be accessed at any given time.

OLTP systems and filegroups with volatile data usually benefit from multiple data files regardless of the underlying storage configuration. The optimal number of files depends on workload and the underlying hardware. As a rule of thumb, create four data files if the server has up to 16 logical CPUs, keeping a 1/8th ratio between files and CPUs afterward.

## Data Pages and Data Rows
The space in the database is divided into logical 8KB pages.

*The data page structure*

A 96-byte page header contains various pieces of information about a page, such as the object to which the page belongs, the number of rows and amount of free space available on the page, links to the previous and next pages if the page is in an index-page chain, and so on.

Following the page header is the area where actual data is stored. This is followed by free space. Finally, there is a slot array, which is a block of two-byte entries indicating the offset at which the corresponding data rows begin on the page.

The slot array indicates the logical order of the data rows on the page. If data on a page needs to be sorted in the order of the index key, **SQL Server does not physically sort the data rows on the page, but rather it populates the slot array based on the index sort order.**

Fixed-length data types, such as int, datetime, char, and others, always use the same amount of storage space regardless of their value, even when it is NULL. For example, the int column always uses 4 bytes and an nchar(10) column always uses 20 bytes to store information.

variable-length data types, such as varchar, varbinary, and a few others, use as much storage space as is required to store data, plus two extra bytes. For example, an nvarchar(4000) column would use only 12 bytes to store a five-character string and, in most cases, two bytes to store a NULL value. SQL Server does not maintain the information about the trailing NULL variable-length columns in the row.

You can reduce the size of the data row by creating tables in a manner in which variable-length columns, which usually store null values, are defined as the last ones in the CREATE TABLE statement. This is the only case in which the order of columns in the CREATE TABLE statement matters.

![Data row structure](/ch-1-Tables-and-Indexes/assets/Data%20row%20structure.jpg)

The first two bytes of the row, called Status Bits A and Status Bits B, are bitmaps that contain information about the row, such as row type, if the row has been logically deleted (ghosted), and if the row has NULL values, variable-length columns, and a versioning tag. 

Null bitmap array uses one bit for each column of the table, regardless of whether it is nullable or not.

A null bitmap is always present in data rows in heap tables or clustered index leaf rows, even when the table does not have nullable columns. However, the null bitmap is not present in non-leaf index rows nor in leaf-level rows of nonclustered indexes when there are no nullable columns in the index.

An optional 14-byte versioning tag is used during operations that require row versioning, such as an online index rebuild, optimistic isolation levels, triggers, and a few others.

The fixed-length data and internal attributes must fit into the 8,060 bytes available on the single data page. SQL Server does not let you create the table when this is not the case.
